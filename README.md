# Exercise 1.3 - Dinosaur

Modify the program so that it will print the following text.

```
Once upon a time
there was
a dinosaur
```

**Note:** Don't worry too much about `if __name__ == '__main__':` at the moment. We don't technically need it for this program, but it's good practise to include it and it'll be clearer in later exercises.
